Because his father worked in the government, he spent his childhood in various places, including Navasota, Texas and Shawnee, Oklahoma. Reed attended the West Division School in Illinois and Woodrow Wilson Grade School in Oklahoma. As a teenager, he went to Central High School in Muskogee, Oklahoma; there, he performed on stage and sang. Meanwhile, Reed worked as a local radio announcer and wrote and produced radio dramas. He went on to attend Northwestern University back in Illinois, where he appeared in many plays. After graduating, Reed studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London for one term.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Reed returned to the United States after his time in London and acted in summer stock in Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania. Later, he joined the theater group the Shakespearewrights, and after that joined the Studebaker theater company in Chicago.

He acted opposite <a href=# title="Florence Henderson Net Worth">Florence Henderson</a> as Carol Brady. From the beginning of the show, Reed was deeply dissatisfied with his role, as he felt it was well beneath his stature as a respectable Shakespearean actor. Although the cast got along well with him, the program's creator, producers, and directors did not. Just as Reed was about to be replaced for the sixth season of "The Brady Bunch" due to his uncooperative behavior, the show was canceled in 1974. However, he eventually returned to appear in various "Brady Bunch" television specials, films, and sequel series, including "The Brady Girls Get Married," "A Very Brady Christmas," and "The Bradys."</p><h2 id=further-television-career><strong>Further Television Career</strong></h2><p>While "The Brady Bunch" was still running, Reed appeared in several television films, including "Assignment: Munich," "Haunts of the Very Rich," "Snatched," and "The Man Who Couldn't Talk to Kids." He also showed up in episodes of "The Mod Squad," "Mission: Impossible," and "Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law." After the end of "The Brady Bunch," Reed had a notable two-episode role on "Medical Center" as a transgender doctor; he earned an Emmy Award nomination for his performance. He earned another Emmy nomination for his work in the 1976 miniseries "Rich Man, Poor Man," and then another the year after that for his performance in the miniseries "Roots." Reed subsequently appeared in the television films "SST: Death Fight," "The Hunted Lady," "Mandrake," and "Love's Savage Fury." He was also in six episodes of "The Love Boat," four episodes of "The Runaways," and two episodes each of "Vega$" and "Fantasy Island."</p><p>In the early 1980s, Reed was in the television films "Casino" and "Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story," as well as the miniseries "Scruples." He also played the main role of Dr. Adam Rose on the short-lived medical drama series "Nurse" from 1981 to 1982. Following that, Reed had guest roles on such shows as "Hotel," "Matt Houston," "Cover Up," "Murder, She Wrote," "Hunter," and "Duet." At the end of the decade, he appeared in episodes of the sitcoms "Day by Day" and "Free Spirit" and the crime dramedy "Snoops."

He passed away in May of the following year in Pasadena, California at the age of 59.
